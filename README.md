# NFT Launchpad 🚀🌌

Welcome to the NFT Launchpad project! This repository contains the source code for a next-generation NFT launchpad, built using cutting-edge technologies like Next.js (TypeScript) for the frontend and Solidity (Hardhat) for the backend smart contracts.

Join us on this exciting journey to explore the decentralized universe and redefine the way NFTs are minted, traded, and showcased!

## 🪐 Features

- Next.js (TypeScript) for blazing-fast frontend performance
- Solidity (Hardhat) for robust and secure smart contract development
- MetaMask integration for seamless wallet connectivity
- Responsive design to ensure a smooth user experience across devices
- Modular architecture for easy feature expansion

## 🛰️ Getting Started

To embark on this interstellar adventure, follow the steps below to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nft-launchpad.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd nft-launchpad

3. Install the dependencies:

yarn install

4. Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory and set the necessary environment variables (e.g., Infura API key, contract addresses, etc.)

5. Start the frontend development server:

yarn frontend


6. In a separate terminal, start the Hardhat local development network:

yarn backend

You're all set! Your NFT Launchpad is now up and running, ready to conquer the decentralized galaxy. 🌠
